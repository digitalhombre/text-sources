An individual's clothing has one Tops slot, one Bottoms slot, one Outerwear slot, one Footwear slot and two Accessories slot (meaning that an individual may wear two accessories). Items in the 'Dresses and Jumpsuits' category take up both a Tops and a Bottoms slot. The combination of these items represents what the individual is wearing (their outfit). To decide upon an individual's outfit, choose one item from the arrays below for each slot.
